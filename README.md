# tap-shopify

`tap-shopify` is a Singer tap for Shopify that uses the GraphQL API. This tap is currently in beta. The schema 
definition is dynamic and retrieves all nested fields that are not connections to other objects. However, it 
may require adjustments. Since we don’t have a real use case for the tap yet, we couldn’t determine the best 
approach. We welcome contributions and feedback

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-shopify` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash

```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-shopify
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-shopify --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-shopify target-jsonl
```
